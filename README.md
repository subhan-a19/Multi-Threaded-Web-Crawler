## Web-Crawler

# Description
This is a multi threaded web crawler coded in C++. It is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing. Any search engine uses these indexes, web graphs, and an appropriate algorithm ( such as PageRank ) to rank the pages. It extract the visited pages from the given base URL and add it to the queue. Finally it prints all the explored pages and size of the queue (number of visited pages). The main focus of the project would be to implement a multi-threaded downloader that can download multi websites at the same time.
